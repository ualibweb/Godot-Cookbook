# Welcome

## The University of Alabama Libraries' Godot Cookbook

This cookbook is a collection of recipes for using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine. It is intended to be a living document, and will be updated as new recipes are added.

## About Godot

Godot is a free and open source game engine. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and can be downloaded from the [Godot website](https://godotengine.org/). Godot uses a custom scripting language called GDScript, which is similar to Python. It also supports C# and C++.

## About this Cookbook

This cookbook is intended to be a collection of recipes for using Godot. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to Godot, but rather a collection of recipes for common tasks. It is also not intended to be a tutorial on how to use Godot. If you are new to Godot, you may want to start with the [Godot documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/).

## Requesting Recipes

If you have a topic or task that you would like to see a recipe for, please submit an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AveryUALibrary/Godot-Cookbook). We sadly will not be focussing on developing any recipes for Godot 3.X or lower. Please include as much detail as possible about what you would like to see using the format below:

```
